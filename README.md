# khipu
A Rustacean and a Data Analyst walk into a bar.
 
 'khipu' named after an Ancient Incan Mystery is a Twitter Stream Processing engine for Sentiment Analysis built with Cargo, Tokio, Brotli and Natural Language processing classification models. 
 WIP: Tread with care.  

Khipus are made of a conglomeration of cotton or wool laces which periodically oscillate as they hang from a cord.
Each string may have several knots, with the type and location of the knot conveying meaning.

Khipus are comprised of am HTTP client capable of making OAuth requests and a server that accepts them. Authentication is acccomplished
by issuing a pair of unique identifiers and a matching secret. khipu expands the credential layer of this transaction by embedding a UUID hashmap for certain keywords (English only) conveying
human emotion: Positive or Negative. Glyphs are tokens which have a matching shared-secret that is use by the client.
